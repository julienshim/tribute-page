            <h2>About &sdot; Oskar Barnack </h2>
            <p id="about">Oskar Barnack (1979-1936) was a German optical engineer, precision mechanic, industrial designer and father of 35mm photography. Very little is known about his personal life. Most of the information about his life revolves around his career at Ernst Leitz (now known as Leica Camera) where he designed the Ur-Leica, a prototype 35mm camera which was developed into the Leica range of viewfinder cameras and further developed into the Leica range of Leica Screw Mount rangefinders.</p>

            <blockquote cite="http://iphf.org/inductees/oskar-barnack/">
                <p>"Barnack’s ingenious invention set fourth new eras in photography, setting new standards for
                    photographic
                    equipment, amateur photographers, art photographers and photojournalists. Leica’s mystique was
                    almost
                    instantaneous; the Leica 35mm camera was the single most influential camera, and it was the most
                    imitated."</p>
